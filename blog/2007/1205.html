<h1>AWB&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Asciidoc Website Builder&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;is Go!</h1>
<p>Once upon a time I wrote all my web pages directly in HTML using a text editor.  MS Word sucked, and I dabbled with DreamWeaver for a while, but never for anything important (personal).  But then I wanted a consistent look and tried out shtml.  Cool, but I needed more power, so I moved over to php.</p>
<p>But the whole php thing has been wearing a bit thin.  I never updated anything because I had to add info in three or five places to get it to build, and of course finding a host was a lot more difficult because they had to support php.  With plain html even geocities would do in a pinch.</p>
<p>I was also getting fed up with writing html.  I mean, it&#8217;s pretty easy, but there&#8217;s so much markup that you need to add, and then it&#8217;s not very readable.  I started looking for an alternative, and decided on asciidoc.  But asciidoc is designed for single documents, or even books, but not websites, and definitely not templating.</p>
<p>So I made my own solution.  It uses asciidoc for markup&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;not that asciidoc has a lot of markup&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and implements templating, automatic generation of blog features, sitemap.xml generation, and other goodies.  The end product is good&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;seriously good&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and I haven&#8217;t even made a release yet.  It&#8217;ll be on Sourceforge soon.</p>
<p>I was casting about for a name for a while, and almost settled on Asciidoc Site Builder (ASB) before realising that AWB would be cooler, with a built-in joke.  AWB is also the Australian Wheat Board, who paid $300m in kickbacks to Saddam Hussein before the war.</p>
<p>Anyhow, you should give AWB a go.  It&#8217;s good stuff, even if I do say so myself.</p>
