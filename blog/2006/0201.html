<h1>Nokia service sucks</h1>
<p>Not so long ago I bought a new Nokia 6030.  It&#8217;s not a really &#8220;smart&#8221; phone, but it works, right?  Well it does <em>now</em>.  I had some trouble with it and as a result sent this mail to Nokia.  (By the way, there are quite a number of nokia service centres in Sydney, I don&#8217;t know which one my phone was sent to.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>I am the unfortunate owner of a Nokia 6030 which is presently at a Nokia Care Centre in Sydney, possibly at your centre in Chatswood.  I bought this phone on December 28 from Allphones in Westfield Hornsby, and after some wrangling with them it was returned for a warranty claim.  The problem was that the microphone didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>On Thursday last week (Jan 19, 2006) I was able to collect a warranty-replacement phone (serial number &lt;removed&gt;) to replace the original (serial number &lt;removed&gt;).  I had intended to take my SIM card when I collected the phone, however I was quite excited that I would finally be able to get and use it, so I collected the phone from the store and went home.  You can imagine my disappointment to find that the LCD screen was non-functional.  I returned to the store that night to have the phone sent out for a warranty claim.</p>
<p>My purpose for writing this email isn&#8217;t to complain bitterly or demand this or that, but just to make a suggestion:  Given that the replacement phone arrived in a NokiaCare box rather than original factory packaging, it would make sense for it to be tested (at least turned on) at the Nokia Care Centre before being sent out.  After all, you do expect a fully-functional product brand-new, especially when it&#8217;s a return from a warranty claim.</p>
<p>I hope that my experience and this email will result in better service for future customers.</p>
<p>Yours truly,<br>
Jared Henley</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t have been surprised that there wasn&#8217;t even a reply email.  If anyone from Nokia ever reads this, your service really sucks, and simply calling it NokiaCare doesn&#8217;t make it any better.  To everyone else, don&#8217;t be surprised if Nokia treats you as its dead-phone finding service.</p>
