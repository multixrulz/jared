<h1>Disabling avahi-daemon</h1>
<p>In a troubling sign for Linux systems, I discovered a while ago that avahi-daemon was running on my system.  Avahi is a service that allows for autodiscovery of network services on the local subnet, and avahi-daemon is the program that advertises services to other computers (ie makes your computer promiscuous).  I&#8217;m really not interested in running programs I don&#8217;t need, and I especially don&#8217;t want avahi-daemon running.  The curious thing was that I had never enabled it.  By some means or another, avahi-daemon was running, and I needed it dead.</p>
<p>Since systemd has taken over the world, the obvious method to do this is:</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<pre><code># systemctl stop avahi-daemon
# systemctl disable avahi-daemon</code></pre>
</div>
<p>But at next boot, avahi-daemon was running again!  What the &#8230;?  There was some kind of message about socket activation, so I tried</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<pre><code># systemctl disable avahi-daemon.socket</code></pre>
</div>
<p>But still avahi-daemon starts with the system.</p>
<p>In frustration, I tried removing the avahi package from my system, but unfortunately it&#8217;s a dependency for stuff like scanning and printing&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;they need it to discover services on the network, and only use the client library.</p>
<p>At this point I began to find agreement with the Lennart Poettering haters (which seems a reasonable direction to vent, since Poettering is responsible for both avahi and systemd, one of which seems to be at fault).  Then, a flash of inspiration.  If I can&#8217;t prevent avahi-daemon from getting started, I can at least prevent it from doing anything.  This turns out to be easier than expected!  In /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf, make these two settings thus:</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<pre><code>use-ipv4=no
use-ipv6=no</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Voila!  Now avahi-daemon fails, as it has no networking enabled.  There are other possibilities in that file too, such as <code>deny-interfaces</code> and <code>disable-publishing</code>.</p>
<p>So in the short term, my problem is fixed!  But in the long term I&#8217;m a little less optimistic about this tendency for the computer to do what it wants, regardless of what it&#8217;s told to do.</p>
